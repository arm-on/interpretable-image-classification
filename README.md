Interpretability methods applied on image classifiers trained on MNIST and CIFAR10
---
This repo includes the files (jupyter notebooks) for the interpretation of two deep neural networks capable of classifying 0-9 digits based on the images belonging to the MNIST dataset, and ten categories (including "airplane", "automobile", "bird", "cat", "deer", "dog", "frog", "horse", "ship", and "truck") of the CIFAR10 dataset.
